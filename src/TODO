the m68k exception vector table lists the spaces used for the different vectors

clean up posix-serial callouts to be like 3c400

is the (brief) extension word handling correct for PC-relative 
EAs when there are multiple brief extension words?  (i.e., is 
first_ea_extword_offset updated (does it need to be?))

in type 8 frames, we currently store the address as it appeared
on the bus - i.e., only 24 bits, not the full 32.  maybe this is
incorrect?

should tme_m68k_rte_start have more RESTARTING checks?

are the data input buffer and data output buffers being kept in the
right endianness in both the trap frames and in the ic buffers?

watch out for (raw[0] << 4) possibly staying 8-bit and then overflowing
in tme_m68k_insn_buffer_xfer

optimization: have the fast executor only execute an instruction if
there are TME_M68K_INSN_WORDS_MAX * sizeof(tme_uint16_t) bytes
available.  note that this does *not* eliminate the need for the
group0 hook entirely, since while we guarantee that we won't fault on
an instruction fetch, we still might fault on data in
mid-instruction-fetch.  this optimization would however remove a 
test and goto in the fast FETCH macros.

probably the way ENA_NONBOOT works on the sun2 is that all FC_SP
references go to the PROM
